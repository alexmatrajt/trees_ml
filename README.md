# Customer Churn Prediction â€“ Telco Dataset

This project predicts customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset from IBM Sample Data Sets.

#### Models Trained
ðŸŒ³ Decision Tree â€“ with class weighting and hyperparameter tuning

ðŸŒ² Random Forest â€“ with grid search and feature importance analysis

âš¡ XGBoost â€“ using scale_pos_weight to handle class imbalance

Performance was evaluated using F1-score, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. A SHAP analysis was conducted to interpret XGBoost predictions and identify the most influential features.
